            <h1>The Helix Nebula</h1>
            <p>
              The Helix Nebula, also known as The Helix, NGC 7293, is a large planetary nebula (PN) located in the
              constellation Aquarius. Discovered by Karl Ludwig Harding, probably before 1824, this object is one of the
              closest to the Earth of all the bright planetary nebulae. The estimated distance is about 215 parsecs (700
              light-years). The Helix Nebula has sometimes been referred to as the "Eye of God" in pop culture, as well
              as the "Eye of Sauron".

            <h1>The Northern Lights</h1>
            <p>
              The bright dancing lights of the aurora are actually collisions between electrically charged particles
              from the sun that enter the earth's atmosphere. The lights are seen above the magnetic poles of the
              northern and southern hemispheres. They are known as 'Aurora borealis' in the north and 'Aurora australis'
              in the south. Auroral displays appear in many colours although pale green and pink are the most common.
              Shades of red, yellow, green, blue, and violet have been reported.

            <p>
              Newgrange is a Stone Age (Neolithic) monument in the Boyne Valley, County Meath, it is the jewel in the
              crown of Ireland's Ancient East. Newgrange was constructed about 5,200 years ago (3,200 B.C.) which makes
              it older than Stonehenge and the Great Pyramids of Giza. Newgrange is a large circular mound 85 meters (93
              yards) in diameter and 13.5 meters (15 yards) high with a 19 meter (21 yard) stone passageway and chambers
              inside. The mound is ringed by 97 large kerbstones, some of which are engraved with symbols called
              megalithic art.
